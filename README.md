# Food_Recipes

I build this app with [Stevdza-San](https://github.com/stevdza-san) 's [Modern Food Recipes App](https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-food-recipes-app-android-development-with-kotlin/) Udemy course and tried to add Material Desing 3 and my knowledge

Food Recipes app; **Dagger Hilt**, **Data Binding**, **DataStore**,**ROOM**, **Coroutines**, **Lifecycle**, **LiveData**, **ViewModel**, **Retrofit**, **Coil** based on **MVVM** Architecture.

Food Recipes from : [Spoonacular API](https://spoonacular.com/food-api)

## Setup

If you want to try this project, before running, be sure you added your Spoonacular API key local properties.

```js

```


## Architecture üèõ

**Model - View - ViewModel (MVVM)** is the industry recognized software architecture pattern that overcomes all drawbacks of MVP and MVC design patterns. MVVM suggests separating the data presentation logic(Views or UI) from the core business logic part of the application

## Libraries üõ† ‚öôÔ∏è
- [Kotlin](https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin) -> The Kotlin Programming Language.
- [Data binding](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/data-binding) -> The Data Binding Library is a support library that allows you to bind UI components in your layouts to data sources in your app using a declarative format rather than programmatically.
- [Data Store](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/datastore) -> Jetpack DataStore is a data storage solution that allows you to store key-value pairs or typed objects with protocol buffers. DataStore uses Kotlin coroutines and Flow to store data asynchronously, consistently, and transactionally.
- [Retrofit](https://github.com/square/retrofit) -> A type-safe HTTP client for Android and the JVM.
- [OkHttp](https://github.com/square/okhttp) -> Square‚Äôs meticulous HTTP client for the JVM, Android, and GraalVM.
- [Coroutines](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.coroutines) -> Library support for Kotlin coroutines
- [Lifecycle](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/lifecycle) -> Perform actions in response to a change in the lifecycle status of another component, such as activities and fragments.
- [Dagger Hilt](https://developer.android.com/training/dependency-injection/hilt-android) -> Hilt provides a standard way to incorporate Dagger dependency injection into an Android application.
- [LiveData](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata) -> LiveData is an observable data holder class.
- [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel) -> ViewModel class is designed to store and manage UI-related data in a lifecycle conscious way.
- [Coil](https://coil-kt.github.io/coil/) -> An image loading library for Android backed by Kotlin Coroutines
